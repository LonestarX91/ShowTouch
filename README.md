I DO NOT PERMIT usage of this code in paid tweaks, copying the code without crediting, etc. Any code you use from here it must be in an open sourced tweak (pay it forward). This code is open sourced for educational purposes only. IF I DO catch anyone stealing code from here and breaking one of the above mentioned things, I will NEVER again open source another tweak of mine.
